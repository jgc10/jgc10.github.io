Competing with the team is the most effective (and fun) method for improving your cybersecurity skills and obtaining experience sought after for internships, jobs, and scholarships.\nThe University of New Haven is also the host of the CPTC New England Regional.\nInterested in joining the team? Check out how to get involved. Red Team #The Collegiate Penetration Testing Competition (CPTC) is an annual offense-focused competition that holds a regional round in November and a Global round in January. Competitors act as penetration testers hired to conduct a security assessment on the client organization, exploiting vulnerabilities in the network and obtaining unauthorized access along the way.\nBlue Team #Blue team competitions force teams to defend their networks against persistent attacks from a red team. Teams earn points for maintaining their services and exterminating attackers from their systems. Two popular blue team competitions, the Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition (CCDC) and Information Security Talent Search (ISTS), both take place during the spring semester.\nCTF #Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions involve solving smaller, individual challenges that challenge competitors to use their exploitation, forensics, reverse engineering, or cryptography skills. Teams earn points with each challenge solved and the team with the most points at the end is the winner. There are many CTF competitions, happening almost every weekend.\nCompetition Placements #* denotes captain\nCPTC 2024 # 2nd place, New England Regional 🥈 Roster: Jonathan Chute*, Jessica Berrios, Mark Daniels, Ronald Scarpa, Ryan Stapleton, Kristine Zurovchak, Matthew Liselli\nCCDC 2024 # Advanced to regionals Roster: Jonathan Chute*, Jessica Berrios, Nicholas Dellagrotte, Matthew Liselli, Jordan Saleh, Ronald Scarpa, Ryan Stapleton, Will Turner\nISTS 2024 # 3rd place 🥉 Roster: Jonathan Chute*, Jordan Saleh, Ronald Scarpa, Ryan Stapleton, Will Turner\nCPTC 2023 # 3rd place, New England Regional 🥉 Roster: Jonathan Chute*, Nicholas Dubois, Jordan Saleh, Ronald Scarpa, Ryan Stapleton, Will Turner\nCCDC 2023 # Advanced to regionals Roster: Jonathan Chute*, Nicholas Dubois, Jordan Saleh, Ronald Scarpa, Devyn Souza, Ryan Stapleton, Zachary Trowbridge, Mateusz Wiszniewski\nCPTC 2022 # 3rd place, New England Regional 🥉 Roster: Charles Barone*, Nicholas Dubois, Jonathan Chute, Matthew Smith, Ryan Stapleton, Mateusz Wiszniewski, Zachary Trowbridge\nCCDC 2022 # Advanced to regionals Roster: Charles Barone*, Nicholas Dubois, Jonathan Chute, Matthew Smith, Devyn Souza, Ryan Stapleton, Zachary Trowbridge, Mateusz Wiszniewski\nCPTC 2021 # 2nd place, New England Regional 🥈 Advanced to international finals Roster: Samuel Zurowski*, Charles Barone, Nicholas Dubois, Mathew Piscitelli, Robert Serafin, Tyler Thomas\nCCDC 2021 # 2nd place, Northeast Regional 🥈 Advanced to national wildcards Roster: Charles Barone*, Steven Atilho, Nicholas Dubois, Killian Meehan, Mathew Piscitelli, Destiny Ray, Robert Serafin, Xenia Sitterer, Tyler Thomas, Samuel Zurowski\nCPTC 2020 # 3rd place, New England Regional 🥉 Roster: Samuel Zurowski*, Charles Barone, Bhavik Nahar, Mathew Piscitelli, Robert Serafin, Tyler Thomas\nCCDC 2019 # Advanced to regionals Roster: Samuel Zurowski*, TJ Balon, Charles Barone, Killian Meehan, Mathew Piscitelli, Robert Serafin, Ilya Shavrov, Tyler Thomas\nCYBERSEED 2019 # 5th place Roster: Samuel Zurowski*, Mathew Piscitelli, Robert Serafin, Tyler Thomas\nCPTC 2018 # 3rd place, Northeast Regional 🥉 Advanced to national finals Roster: TJ Balon*, Peter Casey, Justin Grannis, Trevor Haigh, Matt Topor, Samuel Zurowski\nCPTC 2017 # 3rd place, Northeast Regional 🥉 Advanced to national finals Roster: TJ Balon*, Justin Grannis, James Hebert, Chris Meffert, Rob Schmicker, Matt Topor, Corbin White\nCYBERSEED 2017 # 2nd place 🥈 Roster: TJ Balon*, Chris Meffert, Rob Schmicker, Matt Topor, Corbin White\n","date":null,"permalink":"/team/","section":"","summary":"The cyber@CIT hacking team competes in both red and blue team competitions that provide students with hands-on experience in real-world cyber operations.","title":"Team"}]
